hmmm i generally dont do summaries for contests. bad habit by me ig. apple hard carried us. woot woot. larry carry. most of the problems had "could be better" problem statements. for instance in 5 it was implied that the end of the maze was (n, m) without that being explicitly stated. also some bolding of important things could have been useful. 

apple spent a good amount of time on very hard 4 or problem 14 but we didnt realize that the intended sol was cheese. tilted. overall a good contest. when you're up against a team with purple, abc, bckt, qp or a team with moo, giLGM, vroom, and someone else i forgot or just a team with galen colin and some other really scary teams you're kind of screwed no matter how hard you try. the conclusion is: "take intermediate" or "apple carry".
