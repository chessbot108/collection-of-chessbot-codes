the codes here is organized into the problem bank the solution came from(e.g. usaco, UVa, etc.)
i also have some code from a private problem bank in here
the data structures/algorithms codes are just generalized algorithms

also althought i generally try to commit after AC, there are a few problems here that have the problem ID but dont work. 
dont expect too much since you'll be disappointed. 
also orz to you for actually reading this.
