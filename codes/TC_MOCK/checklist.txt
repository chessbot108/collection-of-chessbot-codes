checklist of things to do before sumbitting

1. make sure it compiles and passes the sample
2. make sure the maximum value in correct (e.g. max_v to 100000)
3. make sure the correct header files are in
4. make sure there are no missed edge cases
5. make sure at least 2 members have confirmed the code works. if the problem is completely free, only 1 is needed

be sure to follow these when testing and hopefully we can reduce our submission count and not lose 20 test cases on problem 12
