i mean. not to say. these are mainly algorithm tempaltes. my graph algorithms codes are pretty old and they were mainly based out of "Introduction to Algorithms" by Thomas Cormen
this isn't strictly algorithms. it would be more accurate to say "things aren't codes for speific problems" or "miscellaneous"

welp, that's all i have to say
